2. Starts first conversation
3. Sends 5-10 messages
4. Creates 2-3 new chats
5. Switches between chats
6. Uses app for 15+ minutes
```

### Stress Testing
```
1. Create 50+ chat sessions
2. Send 100+ messages in single chat
3. Rapidly switch between chats
4. Test with slow network connection
5. Test with intermittent connectivity
```

### Edge Cases
```
1. Very long messages (1000+ characters)
2. Special characters and emojis
3. Rapid consecutive message sending
4. Browser refresh during message sending
5. Network disconnection scenarios
```

## Automated Testing Commands

```bash
# Run local development server
pnpm dev

# Test API endpoints
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"userInput":"Test message","sessionId":"test-123"}'

# Check build process
pnpm build

# Test production build
pnpm start
```
