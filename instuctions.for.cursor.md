An overview of authentication methods for the Whop API

All calls on Whop are made on behalf of a user, and a company ID if applicable, as followed below.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript get-user.ts
  export const whopApi = WhopApi({
    appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY ?? "fallback",
    onBehalfOfUserId: 'YOUR_USER_OR_AN_AGENT_USER',
    companyId: undefined,
  });

  // fetch another user

  await whopApi.FetchPublicUser({ userId: winningUser })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

You are able to make calls on behalf of any user using your app.


# Examples
Source: https://dev.whop.com/api-reference/graphql/examples



Here are some useful queries and their implementations to get you started in Next.JS, Swift, or Python:

### Get messages from a direct message feed

```graphql
query DmsFeedData($feedId: ID!, $postsLimit: Int!) {
  dmsFeedData(feedId: $feedId, postsLimit: $postsLimit) {
    posts {
      content
      user {
        username
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Get current user information

```graphql
query myCurrentUser {
  viewer {
    user {
      id
      username
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
```

### Send chat message

```graphql
mutation SendMessage($input: SendMessageInput!) {
  sendMessage(input: $input)
}
```

### Create a forum post

```graphql
mutation CreateForumPost($input: CreateForumPostInput!) {
  createForumPost(input: $input) {
    # You can specify return fields here if needed
  }
}
```

### Get whops from discover

```graphql
query DiscoverySearch($query: String!) {
  discoverySearch(query: $query) {
    accessPasses {
      title
      route
      headline
      logo {
        sourceUrl
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Implementation Examples

### Python (using requests)

```python
import requests

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "x-on-behalf-of": "user_123",
    "x-company-id": "biz_123",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Example: Fetching DMs
full_query = """query DmsFeedData($feedId: ID!, $postsLimit: Int!) {
    dmsFeedData(feedId: $feedId, postsLimit: $postsLimit) {
        posts {
            content
            user {
                username
                id
            }
        }
    }
}"""

payload = {
    "query": full_query,
    "variables": {
        "feedId": "your_feed_id",
        "postsLimit": 1
    }
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://api.whop.com/public-graphql",
    headers=headers,
    json=payload
)
response_json = response.json()
```

### Next.js (using Apollo Client)

```typescript
import { ApolloClient, InMemoryCache, createHttpLink } from "@apollo/client";
import { setContext } from "@apollo/client/link/context";
import { gql } from "@apollo/client";

// Create HTTP link
const httpLink = createHttpLink({
  uri: "https://api.whop.com/public-graphql",
});

// Add auth headers
const authLink = setContext((_, { headers }) => {
  return {
    headers: {
      ...headers,
      authorization: `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY`,
      "x-on-behalf-of": "user_123",
      "x-company-id": "biz_123",
    },
  };
});

// Create Apollo Client
const client = new ApolloClient({
  link: authLink.concat(httpLink),
  cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

// Example: Discovery Search
const DISCOVERY_SEARCH = gql`
  query DiscoverySearch($query: String!) {
    discoverySearch(query: $query) {
      accessPasses {
        title
        route
        headline
        logo {
          sourceUrl
        }
      }
    }
  }
`;

// Usage
client
  .query({
    query: DISCOVERY_SEARCH,
    variables: { query: "search_term" },
  })
  .then((result) => console.log(result));
```

### Swift (using Apollo iOS)

```swift
import Apollo

// Configure Apollo Client
let url = URL(string: "https://api.whop.com/public-graphql")!

let store = ApolloStore()
let transport = RequestChainNetworkTransport(
    interceptorProvider: DefaultInterceptorProvider(store: store),
    endpointURL: url,
    additionalHeaders: [
        "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
        "x-on-behalf-of": "user_123",
        "x-company-id": "biz_123"
    ]
)

let client = ApolloClient(networkTransport: transport, store: store)

// Example: Get Current User
let getCurrentUser = """
query myCurrentUser {
  viewer {
    user {
      id
      username
      name
      email
    }
  }
}
"""

client.fetch(query: getCurrentUser) { result in
    switch result {
    case .success(let graphQLResult):
        print("Success! Result: \(graphQLResult)")
    case .failure(let error):
        print("Failure! Error: \(error)")
    }
}
```

These examples demonstrate basic usage of the Whop GraphQL API across different platforms. Remember to replace placeholder values (YOUR\_API\_KEY, user\_123, etc.) with your actual credentials.


# Rate Limits
Source: https://dev.whop.com/api-reference/graphql/rate-limits



## Overview

The Whop GraphQL API enforces rate limits to ensure fair usage and system stability.

## Current Limits

```http
10 requests per 10 seconds
```

## Query Complexity Limits

In addition to request rate limits, the GraphQL API enforces query complexity limits:

* **Max Complexity**: 1000
* **Max Depth**: 10

These limits help prevent overly complex or deeply nested queries that could impact performance.
If you encounter these errors, you'll need to break your requests into smaller queries.

Learn more about query complexity and depth here: [https://www.howtographql.com/advanced/4-security/](mdc:https:/www.howtographql.com/advanced/4-security)

## Handling Rate Limits

If you exceed the rate limit, the API will respond with a `429 Too Many Requests` status code.
When this happens, it's best to wait until the rate limit window resets before making additional requests.

## Best Practices

* Implement exponential backoff for retries
* Cache responses when possible
* Batch GraphQL operations into fewer requests


# Schema
Source: https://dev.whop.com/api-reference/graphql/schema



## Why GraphQL

GraphQL is an API interface (alternative to REST) that allows for rapid development and iterative changes to evolving objects.
Whop has built its core product and internal APIs using GraphQL for years, and is now exposing most of the same functionality
via a publicly accessible version.

## Available endpoints

You can explore all available queries and mutations using our Apollo OS explorer:

üîó [GraphQL Explorer](mdc:https:/studio.apollographql.com/public/whop-public-gql/variant/current/explorer)

To make a call, you must pass the following headers:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_APP_API_KEY
x-on-behalf-of: user_1NqS34mOp24
x-company-id: biz_Nq4S34mfp59
Content-Type: application/json
```

| Header           | Description                                                                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Authorization`  | Get from [here](mdc:what-to-build/agentic-businesses#step-1%3A-create-your-app). Must be prefixed with "Bearer". |
| `x-on-behalf-of` | Specifies the User ID of the account you're making requests on behalf of.                                     |
| `x-company-id`   | Specifies the Biz ID to target the business of a user you are calling from.                                   |
| `Content-Type`   | Specifies the format of the request payload as JSON.                                                          |

#### Who can you make requests on behalf of?

Your app can make calls on behalf of users in three ways. Any of these methods grant full access to automating the user's account:

* The User is the original creator of the organization in which your app was created (Ex. your own User ID)
* The User is an Agent User created by the app [here](mdc:what-to-build/agentic-businesses#step-1%3A-create-your-app)
* The User has joined a whop that has installed your app

## API Capabilities

This GraphQL API provides **powerful** access to the entire Whop ecosystem, allowing developers to build sophisticated integrations and applications. Through the API, you can access and manipulate all core Whop functionality, including:

* User management
* Store and product handling
* Messages, forum posts, and live streams

## Development Status

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Note**: This API is still under active development.

While we strive to maintain backward compatibility, some features may be added, modified, or removed

We recommend checking our changelog regularly for updates and announcements about API changes.


# Scopes
Source: https://dev.whop.com/api-reference/graphql/scopes

An overview of authorization scopes for the Whop API

When calling the Whop API on behalf of a user or a company you need to first obtain permissions to do so.

Obtain permission by either:

* **embedded apps** - setting your required scopes in your app's settings in the [Whop dashboard](mdc:https:/whop.com/dashboard/developer)
* **standalone apps** - using the `scopes` parameter when using [Whop OAuth](mdc:features/oauth-guide)

<Note>
  Once you have obtained permissions you can use your app's API key to make
  calls on behalf of the user or company.
</Note>

## Available scopes

* `read_user`: Read the user's basic details. This scope is required and will be automatically granted when users open embedded apps.


# Embed checkout (Public Beta)
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/checkout-embed

Learn how to embed Whop's checkout flow on your website

Embedded checkout allows you to embed Whop's checkout flow on your own website in two easy steps. This allows you to offer your users a seamless checkout experience without leaving your website.

## React

### Step 1: Install the package

```bash
npm install @whop/react
```

### Step 2: Add the checkout element

```tsx
import { WhopCheckoutEmbed } from "@whop/react/checkout";

export default function Home() {
  return <WhopCheckoutEmbed planId="plan_XXXXXXXXX" />;
}
```

This component will now mount an iframe with the Whop checkout embed. Once the checkout is complete, the user will be redirected to the redirect url you specified in the settings on Whop.

You can configure the redirect url in your [whop's settings](mdc:https:/whop.com/dashboard/whops) or in your [company's settings](mdc:https:/whop.com/dashboard/settings/checkout) on the dashboard. If both are specified, the redirect url specified in the whop's settings will take precedence.

### Available properties

#### **`planId`**

**Required** - The plan id you want to checkout.

#### **`theme`**

**Optional** - The theme you want to use for the checkout.

Possible values are `light`, `dark` or `system`.

#### **`sessionId`**

**Optional** - The session id to use for the checkout.

This can be used to attach metadata to a checkout by first creating a session through the API and then passing the session id to the checkout element.

#### **`hidePrice`**

**Optional** - Turn on to hide the price in the embedded checkout form.

Defaults to `false`

#### **`fallback`**

**Optional** - The fallback content to show while the checkout is loading.

```tsx
<WhopCheckoutEmbed fallback={<>loading...</>} planId="plan_XXXXXXXXX" />
```

### Full example

```tsx
import { WhopCheckoutEmbed } from "@whop/react/checkout";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <WhopCheckoutEmbed
      fallback={<>loading...</>}
      planId="plan_XXXXXXXXX"
      theme="light"
      hidePrice={false}
      sessionId="ch_XXXXXXXXX"
    />
  );
}
```

## Other websites

### Step 1: Add the script tag

To embed checkout, you need to add the following script tag into the `<head>` of your page:

```md
<script
  async
  defer
  src="https://js.whop.com/static/checkout/loader.js"
></script>
```

### Step 2: Add the checkout element

To create a checkout element, you need to include the following attribute on an element in your page:

```md
<div data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"></div>
```

This will now mount an iframe inside of the element with the plan id you provided. Once the checkout is complete, the user will be redirected to the redirect url you specified in the settings on Whop.

You can configure the redirect url in your [whop's settings](mdc:https:/whop.com/dashboard/whops) or in your [company's settings](mdc:https:/whop.com/dashboard/settings/checkout) on the dashboard. If both are specified, the redirect url specified in the whop's settings will take precedence.

### Available attributes

#### **`data-whop-checkout-plan-id`**

**Required** - The plan id you want to checkout.

> To get your plan id, you need to first create a plan in the **Manage Pricing** section on your whop page.

#### **`data-whop-checkout-theme`**

**Optional** - The theme you want to use for the checkout.

Possible values are `light`, `dark` or `system`.

```md
<div data-whop-checkout-theme="light" data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"></div>
```

#### **`data-whop-checkout-session-id`**

**Optional** - The session id to use for the checkout.

This can be used to attach metadata to a checkout by first creating a session through the API and then passing the session id to the checkout element.

```md
<div data-whop-checkout-session-id="ch_XXXXXXXXX" data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"></div>
```

#### **`data-whop-checkout-hide-price`**

**Optional** - Set to `true` to hide the price in the embedded checkout form.

Defaults to `false`

```md
<div data-whop-checkout-hide-price="true" data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"></div>
```

### Full example

```md
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<meta charset="utf-8">
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
		<script
			async
			defer
  			src="https://js.whop.com/static/checkout/loader.js"
		></script>
		<title>Whop embedded checkout example</title>
		<style>
			div {
				box-sizing: border-box;
			}
			body {
				margin: 0
			}
		</style>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div
			data-whop-checkout-plan-id="plan_XXXXXXXXX"
			data-whop-checkout-session-id="ch_XXXXXXXXX"
			data-whop-checkout-theme="light"
			data-whop-checkout-hide-price="false"
			style="height: fit-content; overflow: hidden; max-width: 50%;"
		></div>
	</body>
</html>
```


# Login with Whop
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/oauth-guide

Learn how to implement Whop OAuth in a stand-alone application.

## Intro

Use Whop OAuth to authenticate users in your web or iOS app.

<Note>
  This guide only covers the basic steps to implement Whop OAuth and does not cover best practices regarding the OAuth2 protocol. It is recommended to use a library to handle the OAuth2 flow.

  We are going to release a guide on how to implement Whop OAuth with auth.js soon.
</Note>

### Step 1: Create a Whop App and obtain secrets

1. Go to the [Whop Dashboard](mdc:https:/whop.com/dashboard/developer) and create a new app or select an existing one.

2. Add a redirect uri in your apps OAuth settings

   To test your app locally you can add a redirect uri on `http://localhost:{PORT}` but it is recommended to use https for production.

3. Copy the app id and api key and set them in your environment variables.

   Keep in mind that the api key is a secret and should not be shared with anyone. The app id is public and can be shared with anyone.

   ```.env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID=your-app-id
   WHOP_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

### Step 2: Initiate the OAuth flow

#### Setup the OAuth flow

To follow this guide you will need to install the `@whop/api` package from npm:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm i @whop/api
  ```

  ```bash npm
  npm i @whop/api
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn add @whop/api
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Start off by creating a route that will be hit by the user when they click the `Login with Whop` button:

```ts /api/oauth/init/route.ts
import { WhopServerSdk } from "@whop/api";

const whopApi = WhopServerSdk({
  appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY!,
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID,
});

export function GET(request: Request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const next = url.searchParams.get("next") ?? "/home";

  const { url, state } = whopApi.oauth.getAuthorizationUrl({
    // This has to be defined in the redirect uris outlined in step 1.2
    redirectUri: "http://localhost:3000/api/oauth/callback",
    // These are the authorization scopes you want to request from the user.
    scope: ["read_user"],
  });

  // The state is used to restore the `next` parameter after the user lands on the callback route.
  // Note: This is not a secure way to store the state and for demonstration purposes only.
  return Response.redirect(url, {
    headers: {
      "Set-Cookie": `oauth-state.${state}=${encodeURIComponent(
        next
      )}; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Max-Age=3600`,
    },
  });
}
```

<Note>
  Read more about available scopes [here](mdc:api-reference/graphql/scopes).
</Note>

#### Adding the `Login with Whop` button

Now continue by adding a link to your app that will initiate the `Login with Whop` flow:

```html
<a href="/api/oauth/init?next=/home">Login with Whop</a>
```

Upon clicking the link the user will be redirected to the Whop OAuth page and is prompted to authorize your app.

### Step 3: Exchange the code for a token

Upon successful authorization the user will be redirected to the redirect uri you specified in the query parameters with `code` and `state` query parameters:

```ts /api/oauth/callback/route.ts
import { WhopServerSdk } from "@whop/api";

const whopApi = WhopServerSdk({
  appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY!,
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID,
});

export function GET(request: Request) {
  const url = new URL(request.url);
  const code = url.searchParams.get("code");
  const state = url.searchParams.get("state");

  if (!code) {
    // redirect to error page
    return Response.redirect("/oauth/error?error=missing_code");
  }

  if (!state) {
    // redirect to error page
    return Response.redirect("/oauth/error?error=missing_state");
  }

  const stateCookie = request.headers
    .get("Cookie")
    ?.split(";")
    .find((cookie) => cookie.trim().startsWith(`oauth-state.${state}=`));

  if (!stateCookie) {
    // redirect to error page
    return Response.redirect("/oauth/error?error=invalid_state");
  }

  // exchange the code for a token
  const authResponse = await whopApi.oauth.exchangeCode({
    code,
    redirectUri: "http://localhost:3000/api/oauth/callback",
  });

  if (!authResponse.ok) {
    return Response.redirect("/oauth/error?error=code_exchange_failed");
  }

  const { access_token } = authResponse.tokens;

  // Restore the `next` parameter from the state cookie set in the previous step.
  const next = decodeURIComponent(stateCookie.split("=")[1]);
  const nextUrl = new URL(next, "http://localhost:3000");

  // This is an example, you should not store the plain user auth token in a cookie in production.

  // After setting the cookie you can now identify the user by reading the cookie when the user visits your website.
  return Response.redirect(nextUrl.toString(), {
    headers: {
      "Set-Cookie": `whop_access_token=${access_token}; Path=/; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Lax; Max-Age=3600`,
    },
  });
}
```

## Implementing with authentication frameworks

### Auth.js (coming soon)

We will release an extensive guide on how to implement Whop OAuth with auth.js soon.


# Payments and payouts
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/payments-and-payouts

Use the API to collect payment from users or payout users.

## Collecting Payments

First, create the charge on the server using the Whop API. Then you can either:

1. Open a modal in your app using the iframe SDK (recommended)
2. Redirect the user to Whop's checkout page

### 1. Create the charge on the server

> This step will create a charge on the server and return the inAppPurchase object required for the next step.

On the server, use the [chargeUser](mdc:sdk/api/payments/charge-user) method to create a charge:

```typescript app/api/charge/route.ts
import { whopApi } from "@/lib/whop-api";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  try {
    const { userId, experienceId } = await request.json();

    const result = await whopApi.chargeUser({
      input: {
        amount: 100,
        currency: "usd",
        userId: userId,
        // metadata is information that you'd like to receive later about the payment.
        metadata: {
          creditsToPurchase: 1,
          experienceId: experienceId,
        },
      },
    });

    if (!result.chargeUser?.inAppPurchase) {
      throw new Error("Failed to create charge");
    }

    return Response.json(result.chargeUser.inAppPurchase);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error creating charge:", error);
    return Response.json({ error: "Failed to create charge" }, { status: 500 });
  }
}
```

### 2. Confirm the payment on the client

> In this step the user will be prompted to confirm the previously created charge in a modal.

<Warning>
  This function requires the iFrame SDK to be initialized. See [**iFrame
  Overview**](/sdk/iframe-setup) for more information.
</Warning>

Use the iframe SDK to open a payment modal:

<CodeGroup>
  ```tsx React
  "use client";
  import { useIframeSdk } from "@whop/react";

  export default function PaymentButton({
    userId,
    experienceId,
  }: {
    userId: string;
    experienceId: string;
  }) {
    const iframeSdk = useIframeSdk();
    
    const [receiptId, setReceiptId] = useState<string>();
    const [error, setError] = useState<string>();
    
    async function handlePurchase() {
      try {
        // 1. Create charge on server
        const response = await fetch("/api/charge", {
          method: "POST",
          body: JSON.stringify({ userId, experienceId }),
        });
        
        if (response.ok) {
          const inAppPurchase = await response.json();
          // 2. Open payment modal
          const res = await iframeSdk.inAppPurchase(inAppPurchase);
          
          if (res.status === "ok") {
            setReceiptId(res.data.receipt_id);
            setError(undefined);
          } else {
            setReceiptId(undefined);
            setError(res.error);
          }
        } else {
          throw new Error("Failed to create charge");
        }
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Purchase failed:", error);
        setError("Purchase failed");
      }
    }
    
    return <button onClick={handlePurchase}>Purchase Plan</button>;
  }
  ```

  ```tsx Vanilla JS
  import { iframeSdk } from "@/lib/iframe-sdk";

  const paymentButton = document.querySelector("button#payment-button");
  const receiptElement = document.querySelector("span#receiptContainer");
  const errorElement = document.querySelector("span#errorContainer");

  function setError(error?: string) {
    if (errorElement instanceof HTMLSpanElement) {
      errorElement.textContent = error ?? "";
    }
  }

  function setReceiptId(receiptId?: string) {
    if (receiptElement instanceof HTMLSpanElement) {
      receiptElement.textContent = receiptId ?? "";
    }
  }

  if (paymentButton instanceof HTMLButtonElement) {
    paymentButton.addEventListener(
      "click",
      async function onPaymentButtonClick() {
        const userId = this.dataset.userId;
        const experienceId = this.dataset.experienceId;
        if (!userId || !experienceId) {
          throw new Error("Missing userId or experienceId");
        }

        try {
          // 1. Create charge on server
          const response = await fetch("/api/charge", {
            method: "POST",
            body: JSON.stringify({ userId, experienceId }),
          });

          if (response.ok) {
            const inAppPurchase = await response.json();
            // 2. Open payment modal
            const res = await iframeSdk.inAppPurchase(inAppPurchase);

            if (res.status === "ok") {
              setReceiptId(res.data.receipt_id);
              setError(undefined);
            } else {
              setReceiptId(undefined);
              setError(res.error);
            }
          } else {
            throw new Error("Failed to create charge");
          }
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("Purchase failed:", error);
          setError("Purchase failed");
        }
      }
    );
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Sending Payouts

You can send payouts to any user using their Whop username. The funds will be transferred from your company's ledger account.

### Transfer Funds

```typescript
import { whopApi } from "@/lib/whop-api";

async function sendPayout(
  companyId: string,
  recipientUsername: string,
  amount: number
) {
  // 1. Get your company's ledger account
  const experience = await whopApi.getExperience({ experienceId });
  const companyId = experience.experience.company.id;
  const ledgerAccount = await whopApi.getCompanyLedgerAccount({ companyId });

  // 2. Pay the recipient
  await whopApi.payUser({
    input: {
      amount: amount,
      currency: "usd",
      // Username or ID or ledger account ID of the recipient user
      destinationId: recipientUsername,
      // Your company's ledger account ID that can be retrieve from whopApi.getCompanyLedgerAccount()
      ledgerAccountId: ledgerAccount.company?.ledgerAccount.id!,
      // Optional transfer fee in percentage
      transferFee: ledgerAccount.company?.ledgerAccount.transferFee,
    },
  });
}
```


# Create forum post
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/post-to-feed

Create a forum and a post using the API

## Overview

To post in a forum, you must:

1. Find or create a *Forum Experience*
2. Create a *Forum Post* inside the *Forum Experience*

<Info>
  If you already know what forum experience you want to post in, you can skip
  step 1, and use the experience ID directly in step 2.
</Info>

***

## Find or create a forum experience

A forum post must be created within a **Forum Experience**.
The `findOrCreateForum` method will find an existing forum experience with the specified name,
or create a new one with all the specified options

```typescript
 const newForum = await whopApi.withUser("YOUR_AGENT_USER_ID").findOrCreateForum({
    input: {
      experienceId: experienceId,
      name: "Dino game results",
      whoCanPost: "admins",
		// optional:
		// expiresAt: Date.now() + 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000,
		// price: {
        // baseCurrency: "usd",
        // initialPrice: 100,
      // }
    },
  });
```

> This will create the forum in the same whop as the supplied experience.

***

## Create a forum post.

Once you have the `experienceId` from the above, use it to create a post.

### Basic Forum Post

```ts
const forumPost = await whopApi
  .withUser("YOUR_AGENT_USER_ID")
  .createForumPost({
    input: {
      forumExperienceId: newForum.createForum?.id,
      title: "Welcome!",
      content: "Excited to kick things off in our new forum üéâ",
    },
  });
```

* `withUser()`: ID of the user posting
* `forumExperienceId`: The ID of the target forum
* `title` and `content`: Main post body. *(title is optional)*

### Forum post with advanced options

This demonstrates a rich post using all features:

```ts
const forumPost = await whopApi
  .withUser("YOUR_AGENT_USER_ID")
  .createForumPost({
    input: {
      forumExperienceId: "exp_XXXXXX",
      // Visible even before purchase.
      title: "Big Launch + Community Poll!",
      // Visible only after purchase
      content: "Hidden content unless purchased. üîí",
      // Add media to the post.
      // Learn how to upload in the upload-media section
      attachments: [
        {
          directUploadId: "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX",
        },
      ],

      // Do not send a notification to everyone about this post.
      isMention: false,

      // Lock the content and attachments behind a
      // one time purchase in the price + currency.
      paywallAmount: 9.99,
      paywallCurrency: "usd",

      // Add a poll to the post.
      poll: {
        options: [
          { id: "1", text: "New Product Features" },
          { id: "2", text: "Exclusive AMA" },
          { id: "3", text: "Member Giveaways" },
        ],
      },
    },
  });
```


# Send push notification
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/send-push-notification

Send a push notification to a user or a group of users.

```typescript
import { whopApi } from "@/lib/whop-api";

const input = {
  experienceId: "exp_XYZ", // Or userId to send to one specific user.
  title: "Important Update",
  message: "Your new content is now available!",
  // url: "https://example.com/new-content" If blank (recommended, users will be brought to your app view.)
};


const success = (await whopApi.sendNotification({input})).sendNotification;

if (success) {
	console.log("Notification sent successfully.");
} else {
	console.log("Failed to send notification or it's being processed.");
}

```


# Subscriptions
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/subscriptions

Gate your app behind a subscription or one-time purchase

## Setup your access pass on the dashboard.

1. Go to the your [app's dashboard](mdc:https:/whop.com/dashboard/developer).
2. Select the access passes tab and create an access pass. Give it a name like "My App Premium"
3. Create a pricing plan for the access pass by clicking the "Add Pricing" button from the table row.
4. After creating the pricing plan, copy the plan id from the 3 dot menu in the pricing plan card.
5. Also copy the access pass id from the 3 dot menu in the access pass table row.

<Info>
  We recommend storing the access pass id and plan id in environment variables
  for your app. Eg:

  ```bash
  NEXT_PUBLIC_PREMIUM_ACCESS_PASS_ID="prod_XXXXXXXX"
  NEXT_PUBLIC_PREMIUM_PLAN_ID="plan_XXXXXXXX"
  ```
</Info>

## Check if users have access

When a user makes a request to your app, you can easily check if they have access using the whop api.

```typescript
const hasAccess = await whopApi.checkIfUserHasAccessToAccessPass({
  accessPassId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PREMIUM_ACCESS_PASS_ID, // from step 5 above.
  userId: userId,
});
```

If a user does not have access, you can [prompt them to purchase](mdc:#collect-payment-from-users) or show a lite "free" version of the app to upsell them.

## Collect payment from users

<Warning>
  This function requires the iFrame SDK to be initialized. See [**iFrame
  Overview**](/sdk/iframe-setup) for more information.
</Warning>

Use the iframe sdk to collect payment from users. This will show a whop native payment modal in which the user can confirm their purchase.

<CodeGroup>
  ```tsx React
  "use client";
  import { useIframeSdk } from "@whop/react";

  export default function GetAccessButton() {
    const iframeSdk = useIframeSdk();
    
    const [receiptId, setReceiptId] = useState<string>();
    const [error, setError] = useState<string>();
    
    async function handlePurchase() {
      try {
  		const res = await iframeSdk.inAppPurchase({ planId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PREMIUM_PLAN_ID });
  		
  		if (res.status === "ok") {
  			setReceiptId(res.data.receipt_id);
  			setError(undefined);
  		} else {
  			setReceiptId(undefined);
  			setError(res.error);
  		}
      } catch (error) {
        console.error("Purchase failed:", error);
        setError("Purchase failed");
      }
    }
    
    return <button onClick={handlePurchase}>Get Access</button>;
  }
  ```

  ```tsx Vanilla JS
  import { iframeSdk } from "@/lib/iframe-sdk";

  const getAccessButton = document.querySelector("button#get-access-button");
  const receiptElement = document.querySelector("span#receiptContainer");
  const errorElement = document.querySelector("span#errorContainer");

  function setError(error?: string) {
    if (errorElement instanceof HTMLSpanElement) {
      errorElement.textContent = error ?? "";
    }
  }

  function setReceiptId(receiptId?: string) {
    if (receiptElement instanceof HTMLSpanElement) {
      receiptElement.textContent = receiptId ?? "";
    }
  }

  if (getAccessButton instanceof HTMLButtonElement) {
    getAccessButton.addEventListener(
      "click",
      async function onGetAccessButtonClick() {
        try {
          const res = await iframeSdk.inAppPurchase({
            planId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PREMIUM_PLAN_ID,
          });

          if (res.status === "ok") {
            setReceiptId(res.data.receipt_id);
            setError(undefined);
          } else {
            setReceiptId(undefined);
            setError(res.error);
          }
        } catch (error) {
          console.error("Purchase failed:", error);
          setError("Purchase failed");
        }
      }
    );
  }
  ```

# Upload media
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/upload-media

Use Whop to upload images, videos, audio, and other files.

### Client-Side: Set up the Image Upload Component

First, create a component to handle image uploads. This example uses `react-dropzone` for the file upload interface.

```typescript
import { useState, useCallback, useEffect } from "react";
import { useDropzone } from "react-dropzone";

function ImageUploader() {
  // Set up state for the image file and preview
  const [image, setImage] = useState<{
    file: File;
    preview: string;
  } | null>(null);

  // Clean up object URLs when component unmounts
  useEffect(() => {
    const objectUrl = image?.preview;
    if (objectUrl) {
      return () => {
        URL.revokeObjectURL(objectUrl);
      };
    }
  }, [image?.preview]);

  // Handle file drops
  const onDrop = useCallback((acceptedFiles: File[]) => {
    const file = acceptedFiles[0];
    if (file) {
      setImage({
        file,
        preview: URL.createObjectURL(file),
      });
    }
  }, []);

  // Configure dropzone
  const { getRootProps, getInputProps, isDragActive } = useDropzone({
    onDrop,
    accept: {
      "image/*": [".jpeg", ".jpg", ".png", ".gif"],
    },
    maxFiles: 1,
  });

  return (
    <div {...getRootProps()} className="border-2 border-dashed rounded-lg p-8">
      <input {...getInputProps()} />
      {image?.preview ? (
        <img src={image.preview} alt="Preview" className="max-w-full h-auto" />
      ) : (
        <p>Drag & drop an image here, or click to select</p>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Server-Side: Handle File Uploads

Create an API route to handle the file upload using the Whop SDK:

```typescript
import { verifyUserToken, whopApi } from "@/lib/whop-api";
import { headers } from "next/headers";
import { NextResponse } from "next/server";

export async function POST(request: Request) {
  try {
    // Verify user authentication
    const headersList = await headers();
    const userToken = await verifyUserToken(headersList);
    if (!userToken) {
      return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
    }

    // Get the file from the request
    const file = await request.blob();
    
    // Upload to Whop
    const response = await whopApi.uploadAttachment({
      file: new File([file], `upload-${Date.now()}.png`, {
        type: "image/png",
      }),
      record: "forum_post", // or other record types
    });

    // The response includes the directUploadId and URL
    return NextResponse.json({
      success: true,
      attachmentId: response.directUploadId,
      url: response.attachment.source.url
    });
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error uploading file:", error);
    return NextResponse.json(
      { error: "Failed to upload file" },
      { status: 500 }
    );
  }
}
```

### Using Uploaded Media

After uploading, you can use the attachment ID in various Whop features. For example, to create a forum post with the uploaded image (server-side):

```typescript
const createForumPost = async (attachmentId: string) => {
  const post = await whopApi.createForumPost({
    input: {
      forumExperienceId: "your-forum-id",
      content: "Check out this image!",
      attachments: [
        { directUploadId: attachmentId }
      ]
    }
  });

  return post;
}
```

### Supported File Types

The Whop API supports the following file types for upload:

* Images: `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`
* Videos: `.mp4`, `.mov`
* Documents: `.pdf`

### Best Practices

1. **File Size**: Keep uploads under 100MB for optimal performance
2. **Image Optimization**: Consider using libraries like `sharp` for image processing before upload
3. **Error Handling**: Implement proper error handling on both client and server
4. **Clean Up**: Remember to clean up any preview URLs to prevent memory leaks
5. **Security**: Always verify user authentication before handling uploads
6. **Progress Tracking**: Consider implementing upload progress tracking for better UX

### Complete Example

Here's a complete example showing both client and server integration:

```typescript
// app/components/MediaUploader.tsx (Client)
import { useState, useCallback, useEffect } from "react";
import { useDropzone } from "react-dropzone";

export default function MediaUploader() {
  const [image, setImage] = useState<{
    file: File;
    preview: string;
  } | null>(null);
  const [isUploading, setIsUploading] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    return () => {
      if (image?.preview) {
        URL.revokeObjectURL(image.preview);
      }
    };
  }, [image]);

  const onDrop = useCallback((acceptedFiles: File[]) => {
    const file = acceptedFiles[0];
    if (file) {
      setImage({
        file,
        preview: URL.createObjectURL(file),
      });
    }
  }, []);

  const { getRootProps, getInputProps } = useDropzone({
    onDrop,
    accept: {
      "image/*": [".jpeg", ".jpg", ".png", ".gif"],
    },
    maxFiles: 1,
  });

  const handleUpload = async () => {
    if (!image?.file) return;
    
    setIsUploading(true);
    try {
      // Send to your API route
      const formData = new FormData();
      formData.append("file", image.file);
      
      const response = await fetch("/api/upload", {
        method: "POST",
        body: formData,
      });
      
      const data = await response.json();
      
      if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(data.error);
      }

      // Clear the form after successful upload
      setImage(null);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error("Upload failed:", error);
    } finally {
      setIsUploading(false);
    }
  };

  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      <div {...getRootProps()} className="border-2 border-dashed rounded-lg p-8">
        <input {...getInputProps()} />
        {image?.preview ? (
          <img src={image.preview} alt="Preview" className="max-w-full h-auto" />
        ) : (
          <p>Drag & drop an image here, or click to select</p>
        )}
      </div>

      {image && (
        <button
          onClick={handleUpload}
          disabled={isUploading}
          className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded"
        >
          {isUploading ? "Uploading..." : "Upload"}
        </button>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This implementation provides a complete media upload solution with:

* Drag and drop interface
* File preview
* Upload handling
* Progress states
* Error handling
* Automatic cleanup

# Connect to websocket
Source: https://dev.whop.com/features/websocket-guide

Learn how to implement real-time features using Whop's websocket API

You can connect to the websocket from your client side frontend code running in the iFrame.

## Client Setup

### React

When using react, it is recommended to use the `WhopWebsocketProvider` provider from the `@whop/react` package to connect to the websocket.

1. Mount the `WhopWebsocketProvider` provider:

   ```tsx app/layout.tsx
   import { WhopWebsocketProvider } from "@whop/react";
   import { handleAppMessage } from "@/lib/handle-websocket-message";

   export default function Layout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
     return (
       <WhopWebsocketProvider
         // optional, you can join a specific experience channel (ie, the one you are currently viewing).
         joinExperience="exp_XXXX"
         // optional, you can join a custom channel.
         joinCustom="some_custom_channel"
         // optional, a callback that is called when an app message is received. you can also use the `useOnWebsocketMessage` hook to handle messages.
         onAppMessage={handleAppMessage}
       >
         {children}
       </WhopWebsocketProvider>
     );
   }
   ```

2. Handle app messages:

   ```tsx lib/handle-websocket-message.tsx
   export function handleAppMessage(message: proto.common.AppMessage) {
     console.log("Received app message:", message);

     // message.isTrusted is true if and only if the message was sent from your server with your private app API key.

     // message.json is the JSON string you sent from your server / client.

     // if you sent the message from the client using websocket.broadcast,
     // message.fromUserId will include the user id of the user who sent the message.
   }

   // You can also handle messages using the `useOnWebsocketMessage` hook.
   export function MyNestedReactComponent() {
     const [state, setState] = useState<string>("");
     useOnWebsocketMessage((message) => {
       setState(message.json);
     });
     return <div>{state}</div>;
   }
   ```

3. Handle connection status changes:

   ```tsx
   import { useWebsocketStatus } from "@whop/react";

   // inside of a component
   const connectionStatus = useWebsocketStatus();
   ```

### Other frameworks

Alternatively, you can create the websocket client using the `@whop/api` package in any framework.

1. Create the websocket client:

   ```typescript
   import { WhopClientSdk } from "@whop/api";

   const whopApi = WhopClientSdk();

   const websocket = whopApi.websocketClient({
     joinExperience: "exp_XXXX", // optional, you can join a specific experience channel (ie, the one you are currently viewing).
     joinCustom: "some_custom_channel", // optional, you can join a custom channel.
   });
   ```

2. Add event handlers for messages:

   ```typescript
   websocket.on("appMessage", (message) => {
     console.log("Received custom message:", message);

     // message.isTrusted is true if and only if the message was sent from your server with your private app API key.

     // message.json is the JSON string you sent from your server / client.

     // if you sent the message from the client using websocket.broadcast,
     // message.fromUserId will include the user id of the user who sent the message.
   });
   ```

3. Handle connection status changes:

   ```typescript
   websocket.on("connectionStatus", (status) => {
     console.log("Websocket Status Updated:", status);
   });

   websocket.on("connect", () => {
     console.log("Websocket Connected");
   });

   websocket.on("disconnect", () => {
     console.log("Websocket Disconnected");
   });
   ```

4. Connect to the websocket and start receiving events:

   ```typescript
   websocket.connect();
   ```

5. *Optional:* Disconnect from the websocket:

   ```typescript
   websocket.disconnect();
   ```

## Send messages from the client

You can send messages from the client to the server by using the `websocket.broadcast` or `useBroadcastWebsocketMessage` function.

1. Create a websocket client as above.

2. Send a custom message via websocket.

<CodeGroup>
  ```tsx React
  import { useBroadcastWebsocketMessage } from "@whop/react";

  export function SendMessageExample() {
    const broadcast = useBroadcastWebsocketMessage();

    function sendMessage () {
       broadcast({
          message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
          target: "everyone",
       });
    }

    return <button onClick={sendMessage}>Send Message</button>
  }

  ```

  ```typescript Other frameworks
  // make sure you are connected by calling `websocket.connect()`

  websocket.broadcast({
    message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
    target: "everyone",
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  The target field is the same as the one you would pass to
  `whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage` on the server.
</Note>

## Send messages from your server

You can broadcast trusted websocket messages from your server to connected clients by using the `whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage` function.

1. Construct an instance of the whop server sdk and pass your API key:

   ```typescript
   import { WhopServerSdk } from "@whop/api";

   const whopApi = WhopServerSdk({
     appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY,
   });
   ```

2. Send a custom string message via websocket.

   ```typescript
   // Send to all users currently on your app across all experiences / views.
   whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage({
     message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
     target: "everyone",
   });

   // send to all users currently on this experience
   // (only works if the experience belongs to your app)
   whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage({
     message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
     target: { experience: "exp_XXXX" },
   });

   // create a custom channel that your websocket client can subscribe to.
   // Only works if when connecting on the client, you pass the same custom channel name.
   whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage({
     message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
     target: { custom: "some_custom_channel" },
   });

   // send to a specific user on your app
   whopApi.sendWebsocketMessage({
     message: JSON.stringify({ hello: "world" }),
     target: { user: "user_XXXX" },
   });
   ```

## Receive messages on your server

<Info>
  Before you start, make sure you are using NodeJS 22.4 or higher, or Bun to run
  your server.
</Info>

Use the server websocket API to receive events such as chat messages as forum posts for a particular user on your server.
You can use these events to build real-time apps such as chat bots and AI-agents that react to events on the platform.

1. Construct (or reuse) an instance of the whop server sdk and pass your API key:

   ```typescript
   import { WhopServerSdk } from "@whop/api";

   const whopApi = WhopServerSdk({
     appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY,
   });
   ```

2. Create your websocket client and add handlers for messages / status changes:

   ```typescript
   const websocket = whopApi
     // Pass the user id of the user you want to receive events for
     .withUser("user_v9KUoZvTGp6ID")
     // Construct the websocket client
     .websocketClient();
   ```

3. Add event handlers for messages:

   ```typescript
   websocket.on("message", (message) => {
     console.log("Received Message:", message);

     const chatMessage = message.feedEntity?.dmsPost;
     if (chatMessage) {
       // handle the chat message
     }

     const forumPost = message.feedEntity?.forumPost;
     if (forumPost) {
       // handle the forum post
     }
   });
   ```

4. Add event handlers for status changes (same as client API):

   ```typescript
   websocket.on("connectionStatus", (status) => {
     console.log("Websocket Status Updated:", status);
   });

   // Or you can also listen to the connect and disconnect events:
   websocket.on("connect", () => {
     console.log("Websocket Connected");
   });

   websocket.on("disconnect", () => {
     console.log("Websocket Disconnected");
   });
   ```

5. Connect to the websocket and start receiving events:

   ```typescript
   websocket.connect();
   ```

6. *Optional:* Disconnect from the websocket:

   ```typescript
   websocket.disconnect();
   ```

# Introduction
Source: https://dev.whop.com/introduction

Build Whop apps and sell them into Whop communities with thousands of members.

# What are Whop Apps?

A Whop app is a web app that can be embedded into a whop community. These apps can be installed by any Whop creator through our [app store](mdc:https:/whop.com/discover/app-store). As the developer, you can charge for the app using several options offered by our Whop SDK. Our Whop SDK makes it easy to leverage the infrastructure of whop, to build full-blown apps in hours, not weeks.

# Examples of apps

* [AI image generator](mdc:https:/whop.com/apps/app_KHqcozSfEGNyhl/install)
* [Pay-to-play game](mdc:https:/whop.com/apps/app_scKdeUGhiBtYPr/install)
* [Chat bot](mdc:https:/whop.com/apps/app_3rqpGo1tsmPDHg/install)
* [AI car customizer](mdc:https:/whop.com/apps/app_S42iB0COVVUVwO/install)

# Why build Whop apps?

## Distribution

You will be placed in the Whop App Store. The app store is visited by thousands of creators who are looking to offer more value to their communities. You focus on building the best app you can, and we will handle getting you customers.

## Authentication

Zero authentication required. Since your app is embedded into a whop, we handle all user authentication for you. You have access to a load of user information via the Whop SDK.

## Payments

Tap into the power of Whop's payment system. Accept payment with extremely low effort.

# Open External Links
Source: https://dev.whop.com/sdk/external-url

Open external links from within the iFrame

If you want to open external links from within the iFrame, you can use the `openExternalLinks` function. This will close your app and move to a new website.

## Usage

<Warning>
  This function requires the iFrame SDK to be initialized. See [**iFrame
  Overview**](/sdk/iframe-setup) for more information.
</Warning>

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript React
  "use client";
  import { useIframeSdk } from "@whop/react";

  export default function Home() {
  	const iframeSdk = useIframeSdk();
  	
  	function openLink() {
  		iframeSdk.openExternalUrl({ url: "https://google.com" });
  	}
  	
  	return <button onClick={openLink}>Click me to open Google</button>;
  }
  ```

  ```javascript Vanilla JS
  import { iframeSdk } from "@/lib/iframe-sdk";

  const navigationButtonElement = document.querySelector("button");

  if (navigationButtonElement) {
    navigationButtonElement.addEventListener("click", () => {
      iframeSdk.openExternalUrl({ url: "https://google.com" });
    });
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## User Profiles

If you want to display a whop user profile, you can use the `openExternalUrl` method
and pass their profile page link which looks like `https://whop.com/@username`.

The whop app will intercept this and instead display a modal containing their user profile.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript React
  "use client";
  import { useIframeSdk } from "@whop/react";

  export default function Home() {
  	const iframeSdk = useIframeSdk();
  	
  	function openLink() {
  		iframeSdk.openExternalUrl({ url: "https://whop.com/@j" });
  	}
  	
  	return <button onClick={openLink}>Click me to open Google</button>;
  }
  ```

  ```javascript Vanilla JS
  import { iframeSdk } from "@/lib/iframe-sdk";

  const navigationButtonElement = document.querySelector("button");

  if (navigationButtonElement) {
    navigationButtonElement.addEventListener("click", () => {
      iframeSdk.openExternalUrl({ url: "https://whop.com/@j" });
    });
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
  You can also use a user ID instead of username. The final link should look
  like this: `https://whop.com/@user_XXXXXXXX`
</Info>

# Getting Started
Source: https://dev.whop.com/sdk/iframe-setup

Getting started with the Whop iFrame SDK

Whop apps are embedded into the site using iFrames. This SDK provides a type-safe way for you to communicate with the Whop application using a request/response style API powered by `window.postMessage`.

Since this package relies on `window.postMessage`, it only works in **Client Components**.

### Relevant Packages

* `@whop/iframe` - The main package for the iframe SDK.
* `@whop/react` - A React wrapper for Whop Apps including helpers for the iframe SDK.

***

## Setup

The main function exported from the `@whop/iframe` package is the `createSdk` function. When called, this function sets up a listener for messages from the main Whop site, using `window.on('message', ...)`. It is also exposed through the `WhopIframeSdkProvider` component from `@whop/react`.

### React

If you're using React, it is recommended to use the `WhopIframeSdkProvider` component from `@whop/react` to provide the iframe SDK to all child components.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Step 1: Mount provider in root layout
  // app/layout.tsx
  import { WhopIframeSdkProvider } from "@whop/react";

  export default function RootLayout({
    children,
  }: {
    children: React.ReactNode,
  }) {
    return (
      <html lang="en">
        <body>
          <WhopIframeSdkProvider>{children}</WhopIframeSdkProvider>
        </body>
      </html>
    );
  }
  ```

  ```javascript Step 2: Consume the iframe SDK in a component
  // components/example.tsx
  import { useIframeSdk } from "@whop/react";

  export const Example = () => {
    const iframeSdk = useIframeSdk();

    return (
      <button
        onClick={() => iframeSdk.openExternalUrl({ url: "https://example.com" })}
      >
        Open External URL
      </button>
    );
  };
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Other Frameworks

For other frameworks, you can use the `createSdk` function from `@whop/iframe` to create an instance of the iframe SDK.

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Step 1: Create the iframe SDK instance
  // lib/iframe-sdk.ts
  import { createSdk } from "@whop/iframe";

  export const iframeSdk = createSdk({
    appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID,
  });
  ```

  ```javascript Step 2: Use the iframe SDK instance
  // index.ts
  import { iframeSdk } from "@/lib/iframe-sdk";

  const navigationButtonElement = document.querySelector("button");

  if (navigationButtonElement) {
    navigationButtonElement.addEventListener("click", () => {
      iframeSdk.openExternalUrl({ url: "https://example.com" });
    });
  }
  ```
</CodeGroup>

***

<Check>We have now setup the SDK and iFrame.</Check>


# Installation
Source: https://dev.whop.com/sdk/installation

Getting started developing an App on Whop

We recommend you use our TS SDK to build your app. It's a wrapper around our GraphQL API. We have hand-crafted SDK functions that make it easy to use our API.

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm install @whop/api && pnpm install -D @whop-apps/dev-proxy
  ```

  ```bash npm
  npm install @whop/api && npm install -D @whop-apps/dev-proxy
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn add @whop/api && yarn add -D @whop-apps/dev-proxy
  ```
</CodeGroup>

***


# Local development
Source: https://dev.whop.com/sdk/local-development

Run your local setup inside of a Whop iFrame with the Whop proxy

If you are building a Whop app inside of our website, you can use this proxy to run your local setup inside of a Whop iFrame. You can use this proxy with any application written in any language, not just javascript.

### Install

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add @whop-apps/dev-proxy
  ```

  ```bash npm
  npm install @whop-apps/dev-proxy
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn add @whop-apps/dev-proxy
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Run

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm whop-proxy
  ```

  ```bash npm
  npm run whop-proxy
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn whop-proxy
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Note>
  If you are using **NPM**, you need to add `"whop-proxy": "whop-proxy"` to
  the **scripts** section of your `package.json` file.
</Note>

### If you are running a running any app with a `pnpm dev` script:

<Note>
  If you are using **NPM**, you need to add `"whop-proxy": "whop-proxy"` to
  the **scripts** section of your `package.json` file.
</Note>

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm whop-proxy
  ```

  ```bash npm
  npm run whop-proxy
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn whop-proxy
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### If you are running an app that does not have a `pnpm dev` script, for example, a Ruby on Rails app on port 3001:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm whop-proxy --proxyPort=3000 --upstreamPort=3001 --command="sleep 3d"
  ```

  ```bash npm
  npm whop-proxy --proxyPort=3000 --upstreamPort=3001 --command="sleep 3d"
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn whop-proxy --proxyPort=3000 --upstreamPort=3001 --command="sleep 3"
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Configure

The proxy can be configured using the following command line options:

```bash
Usage: pnpm whop-proxy [options]

Options:

--proxyPort <port>      The port the proxy should listen on (3000 by default)
--upstreamPort <port>   The port the upstream server is listening on (set automatically by default)
--npmCommand <command>  The npm command to run to start the upstream server (dev by default)
--command <command>     The command to run to start the upstream server (npm run dev by default)
```


# Retrieve current user
Source: https://dev.whop.com/sdk/retrieve-current-user

Retrieve the public profile information for the currently logged in user

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Next.js
  // app/experiences/[experienceId]/page.tsx

  import { whopApi } from "@/lib/whop-api";
  import { headers } from "next/headers";

  const headersList = await headers();

  // Extract the user ID (this will extract the user ID from the headers for you)
  const { userId } = await verifyUserToken(headersList);

  // Load the user's public profile information
  const user = (await whopApi.retrieveUser({userId: userId})).publicUser;

  console.log(user);
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Not using the Whop TS SDK?

<Accordion title="How to authenticate users in other languages">
  In order to retrieve the current user's ID, you need to decrypt a JWT token that is stored in the `x-whop-user-token` header. `VerifyUserToken` is a helper function in our TS SDK that decodes the JWT token and returns the user's ID.

  If are using a different framework and do not have access to the Typescript Whop SDK, you will need to implement your own JWT decoding logic. Here is an example of how to do this in Ruby on Rails:

  ```ruby Ruby on Rails
  require 'jwt'
  require 'openssl'

  # This is a static public key that is used to decode the JWT token
  # You can put this into your application
  JWT_PEM = <<~PEM.freeze
    -----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
    MFkwEwYHKoZIzj0CAQYIKoZIzj0DAQcDQgAErz8a8vxvexHC0TLT91g7llOdDOsN
    uYiGEfic4Qhni+HMfRBuUphOh7F3k8QgwZc9UlL0AHmyYqtbhL9NuJes6w==
    -----END PUBLIC KEY-----
  PEM

  # In your controller
  user_token = request.headers["x-whop-user-token"]
  return if user_token.blank?

  key = OpenSSL::PKey::EC.new(JWT_PEM)
  payload, _header = JWT.decode user_token, key, true, {
    iss: "urn:whopcom:exp-proxy",
    verify_iss: true,
    algorithm: "ES256"
  }

  jwt_app_id = payload["aud"]

  # WARNING! You must set the WHOP_APP_ID environment variable in your application.
  # This looks like app_xxxx.
  return if jwt_app_id != ENV.fetch("WHOP_APP_ID")

  jwt_user_id = payload["sub"]
  ```
</Accordion>


# Validate access
Source: https://dev.whop.com/sdk/validate-access

Use this API to ensure users have access to use your app

Validate access to an embedded web app:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript Next.js
  import { whopApi } from "@/lib/whop-api";
  import { verifyUserToken } from "@whop/api";
  import { headers } from "next/headers";

  // The headers contains the user token
  const headersList = await headers();

  // The experienceId is a path param
  // This can be configured in the Whop Dashboard, when you define your app
  const { experienceId } = await params;

  // The user token is in the headers
  const { userId } = await verifyUserToken(headersList);


  const result = await whopApi.checkIfUserHasAccessToExperience({
    userId,
    experienceId,
  });

  if (!result.hasAccessToExperience.hasAccess) {
    return <div>You do not have access to this experience</div>;
  }

  // Either: 'admin' | 'customer' | 'no_access';
  // 'admin' means the user is an admin of the whop, such as an owner or moderator
  // 'customer' means the user is a common member in this whop
  // 'no_access' means the user does not have access to the whop
  const { accessLevel } = result.hasAccessToExperience;

  if (accessLevel === "admin") {
    return <div>You are an admin of this experience</div>;
  }

  if (accessLevel === "customer") {
    return <div>You are a customer of this experience</div>;
  }

  return <div>You do not have access to this experience</div>
  ```
</CodeGroup>


# Set up the API client
Source: https://dev.whop.com/sdk/whop-api-client

We provide a TS client that makes it super easy to use our API. We highly recommend you use this client.

Our SDK makes it simple to use our API. It's a wrapper around our GraphQL API with pre-built functions for all of our endpoints. The endpoints are outlined in the SDK reference section of our docs.

### Install

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash pnpm
  pnpm add @whop-apps/sdk
  ```

  ```bash npm
  npm install @whop-apps/sdk
  ```

  ```bash yarn
  yarn add @whop-apps/sdk
  ```
</CodeGroup>

### Setup your client

Create a new file that instantiates the client and exports it. We recommend putting this file at `lib/whop-api.ts`.

This file reads your ENV keys, which can be found on your app developer page on the Whop dashboard.

```ts
import { WhopServerSdk, makeUserTokenVerifier } from "@whop/api";

export const whopApi = WhopServerSdk({
  // Add your app api key here - this is required.
  // You can get this from the Whop dashboard after creating an app in the "API Keys" section.
  appApiKey: process.env.WHOP_API_KEY ?? "fallback",

  // This will make api requests on behalf of this user.
  // This is optional, however most api requests need to be made on behalf of a user.
  // You can create an agent user for your app, and use their userId here.
  // You can also apply a different userId later with the `withUser` function.
  onBehalfOfUserId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_AGENT_USER_ID,

  // This is the companyId that will be used for the api requests.
  // When making api requests that query or mutate data about a company, you need to specify the companyId.
  // This is optional, however if not specified certain requests will fail.
  // This can also be applied later with the `withCompany` function.
  companyId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_COMPANY_ID,
});

export const verifyUserToken = makeUserTokenVerifier({
  appId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_WHOP_APP_ID ?? "fallback",
  dontThrow: true,
});
```

### Example usage

The rest of the examples in this section will use this client and import it from `lib/whop-api.ts`.

Here is an example

```ts
import { whopApi } from "./lib/whop-api";

const user = await whopApi.getCurrentUser();
```
