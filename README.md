## Whop Integration Details

The app uses the Whop iframe SDK for authentication and in-app purchases:

2. **Subscription Management**: Users can upgrade their plans using the capsule-shaped button with multi-color stars
3. **In-App Purchases**: The subscription button uses Whop's `inAppPurchase` function to process payments
4. **User Information**: User profile information is retrieved through the Whop API
